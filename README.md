## Summary of project: 
In this project, we will take the role of a data analyst working for an organization that specializes in global IT and businesss consulting. In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, this organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. 


## Summary of methodologies: 
To accomplish this we will gather data about in-demand technologies from various sources like job postings, training portals, and surveys and create some visualization and dashboards for our team. Data will be gathered in 2 ways: with the Job APIs and with Web Scraping of some Wiki Tables.



## Summary of all results: 
The insights we found with this analysis include the following: 
- Programming languages like Typescript is gaining significant interest and Python continues to grow as well
- Databases like Redis, ElasticSearch, Postgresql, MongoDB are gaining more interest
- Platforms like Slack and Windows are losing significant interest from the tech community
- Webframes like Vue.js is gaining substantial interest and React.js continue to grow as well


## Project questions:
* What are the top programming languages in demand?
* What are the top database skills in demand?
* What are the popular IDEs?

## Documents overview:
In this repository there are 6 notebooks and 1 pdf presentation report. The analysis has been done by following the steps listed below:

**1. Data collection methodology:**
* Data Collection API.ipynb
* Data Collection Web Scraping.ipynb
* DataÂ wrangling.ipynb

**2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA):**
*  EDA with Visualizations.ipynb

**3. Cognos Analytics Dashboard:**
* Dashboard building on IBM cloud

**4. Project presentation:**
* StackOverflow_Report.pdf

## Conclusion:
* Carve out budget in order to hire additional staff with skills needed to fill any gaps.
* Set aside a budget or put a program in place to upskill those already employed.
* Make adjustments in staff for those skills no longer in demand.
